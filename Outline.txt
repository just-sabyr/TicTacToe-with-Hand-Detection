PSEUDOCODE for TicTacToe Using Hand Gesture Recognition:

FUNC index_or_pistol()
    IF handInTheVideoInput THEN
        IF hand_figure == index THEN
            RETURN INDEX
        ELSE 
            IF hand_figure == pistol THEN
                RETURN PISTOL
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ELSE
        RETURN 0
    ENDIF
ENDFUNC

FUNC draw_screen() 
    on each frame adds a 3x3 box in the middle (each box can be either empty, have an O or an X)
    where the whole grid takes a visible area (loose definition?!)

    then displays each frame
ENDFUNC

FUNC draw_winner_screen()
    clean the current screen
    display Player1 or Player2 won message
ENDFUNC


WHILE gameNotFinished
    draw_screen()
    handState = index_or_pistol()
    IF handState == INDEX
        IF tipOfIndexFinger is on a tile
            choose(tile)
            highlight(tile)
            draw_screen() 
        ENDIF
    ENDIF

    IF pistol
        IF chosen_tile is free
            Put X_or_O on the tile
            draw_screen()
        ELSE 
            PASS // Invalid Choice Warning Could be made
        ENDIF
    ENDIF

    IF Winner
        draw_winner_screen(Winner)
        EXIT
    ENDIF
ENDWHILE

Written on April 13: 
    about a month ago I had written TicTacToe cli based game (again for the third time)
    with the intention of making a new version of it
    Days Of Procrastination

    the pseudocode was written today

    // a video from pedropAI (formerly known to me as Rocket Data Science) youtube channel that helped me:
    // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QekxFU0YDqM&list=PLLjn4BxzcNKtUwWeHsGyAkhfRHU32trL5

    Writing on April 14th, a small contribution was made
April 15th:
    hand Recognition part is done, was not easy spent about 3 hours, now can display the grid and show tile that is being chosen_tile

    what needs to be done: make the pistol part work and add the game functionality

Aril 17:
    I could finish the project there is a little bug because I am using a while loop

April 18:
    Not the while loop, the issue was using pop incorrectly, QK helped me solve it. Now the project is functional
